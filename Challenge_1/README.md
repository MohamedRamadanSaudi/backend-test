## Challenge 1: Build a RESTful API with Node.js, Express, Express Validator, and JWT Authentication

### Objective
Create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to manage a Product Inventory System with JWT authentication and authorization middleware.

### Requirements

#### Authentication:
- Use JWT for authentication. Implement a login endpoint (`POST /auth/login`) to generate a JWT token, which will be required to access the protected routes.

#### Authorization:
- Implement authorization middleware to protect routes that require admin access (e.g., adding, updating, and deleting products).
- Authorization middleware should check the role from the decoded JWT token and ensure only users with the `admin` role can access these routes.

#### Endpoints:
- **POST /auth/login**: User login (returns a JWT token).
- **POST /products**: Add a new product (`name`, `category`, `price`, `quantity`). Only accessible to admin.
- **GET /products**: List all products with pagination (10 products per page).
- **GET /products/:id**: Get a single product by its ID.
- **PUT /products/:id**: Update a product. Only accessible to admin.
- **DELETE /products/:id**: Delete a product. Only accessible to admin.

#### Input Validation (using Express Validator):
- Use Express Validator for validation on the POST and PUT endpoints.
- Ensure the following validations:
  - `name` is required.
  - `category` is optional but should be a string.
  - `price` should be a positive number.
  - `quantity` should be a non-negative integer.

#### Database:
- Use MongoDB for storing product data with the following schema:

```json
{
  "name": String,
  "category": String,
  "price": Number,
  "quantity": Number,
  "createdAt": Date,
  "updatedAt": Date
}
```

## Features:
- Implement basic validation for required fields and proper error handling using Express Validator.
- Ensure security best practices for authentication and authorization.

## Challenge 2: Database Query Optimization

### Objective
Write optimized SQL/NoSQL queries to retrieve product data efficiently.

Requirements
SQL Query: (Assuming PostgreSQL)

Write a query to fetch products with a price between $50 and $200, ordered by price (ascending), with pagination (10 products per page).
NoSQL Query: (Assuming MongoDB)

Write a query to retrieve products by category (e.g., "Electronics"), sorted by price in descending order. Limit the result to 5 products per page.
Optimization:

How would you optimize the queries for high traffic scenarios (e.g., indexing, caching)?
